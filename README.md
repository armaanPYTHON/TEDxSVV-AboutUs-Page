# TEDxSVV-AboutUs-Page

Hi!

This is a sample TEDx SVV about us page. There are 4 sections mainly: The banner, About TED, About TEDx and About TEDxSVV.
There are read-more buttons for last three sections out of which first 2 are linked and the 3rd one is optional in case the organisation is interested in providing additional information.

No header or footer is included as it was a single responsive page assignment.

As for the UI, I have seen the current about us page. It was really good but the whole page, in fact the whole site was covered in colorful division with no white spacing.
This website (the one I created) has more white spacing to give it a nice, elegant look rather than adding too many microanimations and too much chaos.
