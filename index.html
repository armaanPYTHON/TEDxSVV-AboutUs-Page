            <h1>About TED</h1>
            <p>TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks. TED began in 1984 as a conference where technology, entertainment and design converged, and today covers almost all topics - from science
                to business to global issues - in more than 100 languages. It is a global community, welcoming people from every discipline and culture who seek a deeper understanding of the world.</p>

            <h1>And TEDx?</h1>
            <p>The TEDx Program is designed to help communities, organizations and individuals to spark conversation and connection through local TED-like experiences. At TEDx events, a screening of TED Talks videos — or a combination of live presenters
                and TED Talks videos — sparks deep conversation and connections at the local level. TEDx events are planned and coordinated independently, under a free license granted by TED.</p>

                TEDxSomaiyaVidyavihar is an independently organised TED-like event by K.J.Somaiya College of Engineering and K.J.Somaiya Institute of Management Studies and Research. Our vision is to make TEDxSomaiyaVidyavihar a platform where community-driven people
                can showcase their ideas that will lead to a change in attitudes, lives and, ultimately, the world.
